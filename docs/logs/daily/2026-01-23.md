# Daily Log — 2026-01-23

- Renamed runtime keys and branding from `Kira`/`Codelumi` to `Lumi` across active sources.
- Updated localStorage keys: `codelumi_*` -> `lumi_*` (conversation, feedback, model filename, KB download name, 3D position key).
- Updated packaging and build metadata to `Lumi Desktop` and `com.yourname.lumi`.
- Renamed exported/training KB references and tooling usage to `lumi_knowledge.json`.
- Created `training/lumi_knowledge.json` (seed KB). Left original `training/codelumi_knowledge.json` as a backup copy.

Notes:
- Active source and tooling references updated. Archive and backup files still contain legacy names intentionally.
- Next steps: run the app and smoke-test IPC (`lumi-*`), KB save/load, conversation history, and exports. Consider adding a migration fallback to read old `codelumi_*` keys into `lumi_*` on first run to preserve user data.
