Draft Trademark Application — CodeLumi (Tortol studios)

Use this as a starting draft for filing a trademark application (USPTO TEAS or equivalent).
This is a template — replace placeholders before filing and consult a trademark attorney.

Owner / Applicant:
- Legal entity name: Tortol studios
- Entity type: [e.g., Individual / LLC / Corporation] (fill in)
- Primary contact email: Tortolcoin@gmail.com
- Address: [street, city, state/province, country, postal code]

Mark:
- Word mark: CODELUMI (standard character mark for CodeLumi)
- Standard characters (no claim to any particular font, style, color)
- Mark shown in use (specimen will show the mark as displayed in the app UI and website)

Goods / Services (suggested descriptions — tailor to actual use):
- International Class 9: Downloadable computer software for use as a virtual assistant; downloadable mobile applications featuring an AI assistant; computer programs for use in performing natural language processing and conversational AI.
- International Class 42: Hosting of computer software applications; providing online non-downloadable software as a service (SaaS) featuring an AI assistant and knowledge-base management.
- International Class 41 (optional): Entertainment services, namely, providing an animated virtual character and interactive experiences via downloadable software.

Basis for filing:
- Select either:
  - "Use in commerce" (if the mark is already used publicly). You must provide date of first use in commerce and date of first use anywhere.
  - "Intent to use" (if you plan to use but have not yet). You may file now and later submit a "Statement of Use" after the mark is in use.

Specimens (what to submit):
- Examples of acceptable specimens:
  - Screenshot of the running desktop app showing the mark near the avatar or app header (e.g., `dist/index.html` visible with the word "CodeLumi" or logo).
  - Screenshot of the product page, README, or website where the mark is used in commerce (download link, purchase, or distribution page).
  - App store listing screenshot showing the mark and a reference to distribution (if applicable).
- Prepare high-resolution PNGs and include a short caption for each specimen describing where and when it was first used.

Filing text (sample field entries)
- Mark drawing code: 4 (Standard Character Mark)
- Goods/services (copy the Class 9 and Class 42 text above or tailor as necessary)
- Filing basis: Use in Commerce OR Intent to Use (choose appropriately)
- Owner: Tortol studios (select "corporation"/"individual" correctly)

Suggested evidence of use (keep in `docs/tm_evidence/`):
- `screenshot-app-home.png` — app showing mark in UI (date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- `screenshot-website-download.png` — website/download page
- `screenshot-store-listing.png` — app store page (if published)
- Release notes or change log showing distribution date

Implementation steps in the repository (what to add before/after filing):
1. Add a clear trademark notice in `README.md` (done). Use `CodeLumi™` while pending and `CodeLumi®` after registration.
2. Add TM text in `docs/brand.md` with do's/don'ts and a link to the TM application record.
3. Add the mark visibly in the app UI (e.g., about dialog, footer, or avatar label) as `CodeLumi™`.
4. Save specimens (screenshots) to `docs/tm_evidence/` and ensure dates are recorded.
5. Keep copies of the signed installer or release package showing the mark used in commerce.

Filing process (high-level):
1. Run a trademark clearance search (USPTO TESS, EUIPO, WIPO). Document results.
2. Decide filing basis (use vs intent-to-use). Collect specimens if using.
3. Create a TEAS account (USPTO) and fill TEAS Plus or TEAS Standard form. Pay the fee (approx. $250–$350 per class in the U.S.).
4. Monitor the application: respond to Office Actions if issued.
5. If approved for publication, monitor for oppositions. If no oppositions and all paperwork is in order, receive registration.

Timeline and cost (approximate):
- Search: free (self) to few hundred USD (paid services).
- Filing fee: ~$250–$350 per international class (USPTO TEAS Plus/Standard).
- Examination & publication: typically 6–12 months; may take longer if Office Actions occur.

Post-registration: use ®, file maintenance and renewal (usually between 5–10 years depending on jurisdiction), and consider international filings via Madrid Protocol for broader coverage.

Notes & cautions:
- This document is a non-lawyer template. For formal filing strategy, class selection, and enforcement planning consult a trademark attorney.
- If you plan international commercialization, consider an international filing strategy early.
