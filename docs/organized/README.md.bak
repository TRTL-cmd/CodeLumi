**Kira organized docs**

This folder contains an organized, flat copy of key Kira documents for quick access.

- `daily_logs/` — daily log template and entries (KIRA_DAILY_LOG.md)
- `kira_md/` — consolidated Kira documents (safety charter, roadmap, master docs, runbook)
- `readmes/` — flat copies of README files from `docs/readmes/` for quick reference

Safety & alignment:
- The `kira_md/KIRA_SAFETY_CHARTER.md` file is the canonical safety charter. Teams and automation should consult it before any state-changing actions.
- The Roadmap and Master Documentation files were copied here to make the Neural Link and safety-first priorities visible.

If you want these files moved instead of copied, or want additional README files included, tell me which ones to add or remove.
