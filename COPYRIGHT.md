Copyright & Registration — CodeLumi

1) Recommended copyright notice

  Copyright (c) 2026 Tortol studios. All rights reserved.

Place this notice in `README.md` and consider adding a short header to major source files, e.g.:

  // Copyright (c) 2026 Tortol studios. All rights reserved.

2) What is covered

- Source code (`src/`, `scripts/`, build output)
- Documentation (`docs/`, README, design files)
- UI assets (icons, images, SVGs)
- 3D assets and model files (`assets/models/`)
- Audio, prose, and other expressive works

3) Registration (optional but recommended for enforcement)

- In the United States, registering with the U.S. Copyright Office provides the ability to sue for statutory damages and attorneys' fees in many cases.
- Registration is typically per "work" or collection; you can register the source code as a single deposit (a ZIP of `src/` and build artifacts).
- In other jurisdictions, check local copyright office procedures (EU, UK, CA, AU, etc.).

4) Practical steps

- Add the notice above in `README.md` and top-of-file headers for key source files.
- Keep dated snapshots/archives of releases (ZIP + changelog) to support evidence of authorship.
- Consider registering important releases if you may need strong enforcement.

5) DMCA / takedown

- Keep a contact email for notices; prepare a DMCA takedown template.
- Preserve evidence of infringement (screenshots, URLs, copies) and consult counsel before sending aggressive notices.
