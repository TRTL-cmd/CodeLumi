Trademark Checklist — CodeLumi

1) Decide what to protect

-- Word marks: "CodeLumi" and any product/subproduct names.
- Logos and app icons.
- Taglines or short slogans used in commerce.
- Distinctive UI elements or trade dress (harder to enforce).

2) Clearance search

- Perform a trademark clearance search (USPTO TESS in the U.S., EUIPO, WIPO Global Brand Database).
- Search common-law use via web, app stores, domains, and marketplaces.

3) Adopt and use consistently

- Start using the mark with `TM` (™) for unregistered marks; use `®` only after registration.
- Publish a short brand usage guideline (logo spacing, colors, do/don't) and include it in `docs/brand.md` or similar.

4) Domain and social handles

- Register relevant domains (e.g., codelumi.com, codelumi.app). Use defensive registrations for major TLDs.
- Reserve social handles used by your product.

5) File registration

- Choose jurisdiction(s) where you sell/market. File nationally (e.g., USPTO in U.S.) or via Madrid Protocol for international coverage.
- Select appropriate classes (software, downloadable apps, character services, etc.). Consult counsel for class selection.
- Prepare specimens showing the mark in use (website screenshots, app store listing).

6) Monitor & enforce

- Use a watch service or set up Google alerts for exact-match monitoring.
- If you find infringing uses, consider a polite outreach, then cease-and-desist, then registrar/app-store complaints, then counsel.

7) Maintain records & renewals

- Keep dated marketing materials, screenshots, and release notes showing continuous use.
- Monitor renewal deadlines (usually every 10 years for registrations in many jurisdictions; some require maintenance filings earlier).

8) Practical templates & next actions

- Draft a short Trademark Use Policy for `docs/` — who may use your logo and under what conditions.
- Prepare a simple cease-and-desist email template (keep it factual, cite the mark, show ownership, request removal).
-- Consider an initial TM filing for the `CodeLumi` word mark if clearance is clear.

9) When to get a lawyer

- For filing strategy, international scope, class selection, or enforcement, engage a trademark attorney.
